### 👋 Heya, I am Anmol K Sachan (FR13ND0x7f) 

Skilled and adaptable team player. Builder, developer, problem solver and
penetration tester. Hacking is not about mastering one tool or another. It is a process, a way of thinking. If I really want into a system, then I will opt for custom written malware/exploits that I write myself. 
In short I'm Consistent Security Researcher with the desire to make a difference.
